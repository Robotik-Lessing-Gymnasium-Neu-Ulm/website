The world championship has come to an end and thus this season of robpocup junior.   
This year our students visited the beautiful city Bordeaux, France.

many exciting games, technical challenges and interviews following final score was certain
after those five days: 
 - Team Faabs (Soccer Open) &rarr; World Champion 🥇
 - Team Faabs (Soccer Open) &rarr; Winner of the "Outstanding Design Award" 🎖️
 - Team Robotronic (Soccer LightWeight) &rarr; Winner of the "Super Team Challenge" 🎖️
