many exciting games, technical challanges and interviews following final score was certain
after those five days: 
 - Team Faabs (Soccer Open) &rarr; world champion
 - Team Faabs (Soccer Open) &rarr; winner of the "Best Hardware Awards"
 - Team Robotronic (Soccer LightWeight) &rarr; Winner of the "Super Team Challange"
